# ECE763 Adaboost-HAAR

**Subject** - ECE 763 Computer Vision <br>
**Project Name** - Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost) for Face Detection
**Project Grade** - A+ <br>

**Description** -
1. Ensemble Learning Adaboost algorithm is implemented for face detection.
2. 16x16 (face & non face) 2000 training & 400 test images were used.
3. Haar features formed weak classifiers which were input to adaboost algorithm.
